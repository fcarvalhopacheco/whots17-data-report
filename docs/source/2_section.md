## WHOTS-17 Cruise: WHOTS-17 Mooring Deployment

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Upper Ocean Processes Group (WHOI/UOP)
, with assistance from the UH group, successfully carried out the 17th
deployment of the WHOTS mooring during the WHOTS-17 cruise. This operation took
place on board the Oscar Elton Settle between August 24 and September 1, 2021.
The WHOTS-17 mooring was deployed at Station 50 on August 26, 2021, at 03:13
UTC, at 22°46.042'N, 157°53.795'W. Additionally, the WHOTS-16 mooring was recovered on August 28, 2021.

The scientific personnel that participated during the cruise are listed in

The UH group conducted the shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise. A complete description of these operations is available in the
{cite}`Santiago-Mandujano2022a`

A Sea-Bird CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) system was used measure
T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD casts. The time, location, and maximum CTD
pressure for each profile are listed in {numref}`table-2`. Ten CTD casts were
conducted during the WHOTS-17 cruise, from August 24 through September 1. CTD
profile data were collected at Station 20 (in transit to the WHOTS mooring),
Station 50 (near the WHOTS-17 buoy), Station 52 (near the WHOTS-16 buoy), and
at Station 2 at the ALOHA site. The cast at Station 20 was 1508 m deep, and
three acoustic releases (two to be used in the WHOTS-17 mooring and one backup)
were attached to the rosette frame for function testing. Five CTD yo-yo casts
and one near-bottom CTD cast were conducted to obtain profiles for comparison
with subsurface instruments on the WHOTS-17 mooring after deployment, and two
yo-yo casts were conducted for comparison with the WHOTS-16 mooring before
recovery. The yo-yo casts were started about 0.25 nm from the buoys with
varying drift during each cast, and consisted of 5 up-down cycles between near
the surface and 202 to 204 m. One additional near-bottom CTD cast was conducted
at Station ALOHA. The CTD had modulo errors during some of the casts,
displaying some glitches.

Water samples were taken from all casts; 3 to 4 samples for
each of them. These samples were to be analyzed for salinity at UH and used to
calibrate the CTD conductivity sensors.

Also, continuous ADCP and near-surface thermosalinograph data were obtained
while underway.

The R/V Oscar Elton Settle was equipped with a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 75 kHz ADCP,
set to function in broadband and narrowband configurations. The configuration
information is shown in {numref}`table-3`. The ADCP utilized primary heading
measurements from a SAMOS gyrometer, with additional heading corrections
obtained from [Trimble ABX-Two gyrocompass](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1521/1/).
GPS positions were derived from [Furuno GP-170 GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1633/1/).

Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-17 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water from the continuous seawater
system running through the ship, and were comprised of one thermosalinograph
model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a micro-thermosalinograph model SBE-45 (SN 0290),
both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s
chemistry lab, about 70 m from the hull intake; and an SBE-38 (SN 266) external temperature sensor located at the entrance of the water intake.
All instruments recorded data every second. The water intake was located at the
bow of the ship, forward from the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 3
m. The system had a flow meter in the chemistry lab, showing a flow rate of
about 1.1 liter/minute during the cruise. Only the SBE-45 had a debubbler.
Salinity water samples were taken every 8 hours from the exhaust in the
Chemistry lab using 0.25 litter glass bottles, to be measured in the
UH lab to correct for any drift in the thermosalinograph conductivities.

Both thermosalinographs exhibited a number of conductivity and temperature
glitches due to air going into the plumbing. In addition,
the system had a drainage problem according to the ship’s technician. The data
between August 26 at 13:30 and 27 at 07:00 are particularly bad because it was
during transit back to Oahu to disembark a crew member with medical problems,
and the flow through the system was stopped during that time. The temperature
differences between the internal SBE-45 and SBE-21 were between -0.5 and 0.5°,
and the conductivity differences were ±0.007 S/m resulting
in a salinity difference of about ±0.05 g/kg. These
conductivities were calibrated against the bottle samples collected during
the cruise, and the bad data was be flagged. A diurnal cycle was apparent in
the temperature and conductivity.

## WHOTS-18 Cruise: WHOTS-17 Mooring Recovery

The WHOI/UOP Group conducted the mooring turnaround operations during the
WHOTS-18 cruise between July 23, and July 27, 2022. The WHOTS-18 mooring was
deployed at Station 52 on July 24, 2022, 02:17 UTC at 22 40.002'N, 157
56.793'W, and the WHOTS-17 mooring was recovered on July 25, 2022, 18:03 UTC.
The scientific personnel that participated during the cruise are listed in
{numref}`table-4`.

The UH group conducted the shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise. A complete description of these operations is available in the WHOTS-18
cruise report {cite}`Santiago-Mandujano2022b`.

A Sea-Bird CTD system was used to measure T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD
casts. The time, location, and maximum CTD pressure for each profile are listed
in {numref}`table-5`. Nine CTD casts were conducted during the WHOTS-18 cruise
from July 23 through July 27. CTD profile data were collected at Station 20 (in
transit to the WHOTS mooring), Station 50 (near the WHOTS-17 buoy), and Station
52 (near the WHOTS-18 buoy). The cast at Station 20 was 1501 m deep, and three
acoustic releases (two to be used in the WHOTS-18 mooring and one backup) were
attached to the rosette frame for function testing. Four CTD yo-yo casts were
conducted to obtain profiles for comparison with subsurface instruments on the
WHOTS-18 mooring after deployment, and four yo-yo casts were conducted for
comparison with the WHOTS-17 mooring before recovery. The yo-yo casts were
started about 0.25 nm from the buoys with varying drift during each cast and
consisted of 5 up-down cycles between near the surface and 203 to 210 m. The
first set of T, C, and O2 sensors displayed bad data during various casts,
apparently due to problems with the cable termination, but the second sensor
set displayed good data.

Between 3 and 4 water samples were taken from all casts, except from Station 52
casts 2, 3 and 4, in which the pylon failed to communicate with the CTD. These
samples were to be analyzed for salinity at UH and used to calibrate the CTD
conductivity sensors. Station numbers were assigned following the convention
used during HOT cruises.

Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-18 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water from the continuous seawater
system running through the ship, and were comprised of one thermosalinograph
model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a micro-thermosalinograph model SBE-45 (SN 0290),
both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s

All instruments recorded data every second. The water intake was located at the
bow of the ship, forward from the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 3
m. The system had a flow meter in the chemistry lab, showing a flow rate of
about 1.1 liter/minute during the cruise. Only the SBE-45 had a debubbler.
Salinity water samples were taken every 8 hours from the exhaust in the
Chemistry lab using 0.25 litter glass bottles, to be measured in the
UH lab to correct for any drift in the thermosalinograph conductivities.

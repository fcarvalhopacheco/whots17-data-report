# Results

During the WHOTS-17 cruise (WHOTS-17 mooring deployment, August 24 - September
1, 2021), a high-pressure ridge far north of the Hawaiian Islands maintained a
tight enough pressure gradient down across the region to produce moderate to
locally strong trades. As this high slowly moved northeast away from the area
and subtly weakened the gradient, trades gradually weakened. There was no
measurable precipitation during the deployment or recovery times.

Near-surface currents were nearly 1 kt west-northeastward between Oahu and
Station ALOHA, and was seen in the shipboard ADCP record during the transit
from ALOHA to Oahu on August 26 to disembark an injured crew member, and during
the transit back to Oahu at the end of the cruise on September 1. This WNWward
flow seemed to be associated with a high sea level just east of Station ALOHA
. Surface currents during the WHOTS-16 mooring recovery were less than
1 kt. A combination of internal 53 semidiurnal and diurnal tides,
along with near-inertial oscillations, were noticeable especially in vertical
shear.

Conditions during the WHOTS-17 deployment on August 26 were favorable, with
light ENE winds of ~ 10 kt by the end of the deployment. There were clear skies
and no precipitation in the region, and small short- period wind waves. CTD
casts conducted near the WHOTS-17 buoy (Station 50) ({numref}`figure6.2`,
{numref}`figure6.3`, {numref}`figure6.4`), after recovering WHOTS-16 mooring,
displayed a subsurface salinity maximum between 140 and 160 dbar and a mixed
layer 40 to 80 dbar deep.

During the WHOTS-18 cruise (WHOTS-17 mooring recovery, July 22-27, 2022), a
high-pressure ridge far north of the Hawaiian Islands maintained a tight enough
pressure gradient down across the region to produce moderate local trades,
increasing by the end of the cruise. There was no measurable precipitation
during the deployment or recovery times. CTD casts conducted near the WHOTS-17
buoy (Station 50)({numref}`figure6.6`,{numref}`figure6.7`,{numref}`figure6.8`), after deploying
the WHOTS-18 mooring, displayed a subsurface salinity maximum between 100 and
160 dbar and a mixed layer of 60 dbar deep.

The temperature MicroCAT records during the WHOTS-17 deployment
({numref}`wh17_Temp_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh17_Temp_17_20.png`) show
noticeable seasonal variability in the upper 100 m. The salinity
records ({numref}`wh17_Sali_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh17_Sali_17_20.png`) do
not show an apparent seasonal cycle, but a salinity decrease was recorded from 
mid April through June 2022 in 
the upper 65 m. This decrease was followed by a period with high salinity.

{numref}`w1_17_contTS.png` through {numref}`w1_17_cont_S.png` show contours of
the WHOTS-17 MicroCAT data in context with data from the previous 16
deployments. The seasonal cycle is evident in the temperature record, with
record temperatures (higher than 26°C) in the summer of 2004, and again in
2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. Salinities in the subsurface salinity maximum
were relatively low during the first 6 years of the record, only to increase
drastically after 2008 through 2015, with some lower salinity episodes in
mid-2011 and early 2012. The salinity maximum extended to near the surface in
early 2010, 2011, late2012-early 2013, and February-March 2013. Salinities in
the salinity minimum decreased after 2015, showing low salinities above 100 m
in 2016, 2017, 2018, and reaching record low values (34.4) in July-August 2019
and July-September 2020 and increasing in 2021. When plotted in {math}`\sigma\theta` coordinates
({numref}`w1_17_cont_S.png`), the salinity maximum seems to be centered roughly
between 24 and 24.5 {math}`\sigma\theta`.

Records from the WHOTS-17 MicroCATs ({numref}`plt_w17_aco.png`) deployed
near the bottom of the mooring (4659 m) detected temperature and salinity
changes related to episodic ‘cold events’ apparently caused by bottom water
moving between abyssal basins {cite}`Lukas2001`. These events are being
monitored by instruments at the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) {cite}`Howe2011`
, a deep water observatory located at the bottom of Station ALOHA (about 6
nautical miles north from the WHOTS-17 anchor), since June 2011.
{numref}`plt_w17_aco.png` shows temperature and salinity records from
the WHOTS-17 MicroCATs superimposed on the ACO data. The MicroCAT data
agreed with the temperature decrease and the salinity increase registered by 
ACO instruments during cold events in September 2021 and July 2022. Minor events 
in January and February 2022 were registered by the MicroCATs, but not by the ACO 
instruments.

{numref}`WHOTS-17_u_subplot.png` through {numref}`WHOTS-17_w_subplot.png` shows
the time series of the zonal, meridional, and vertical currents recorded with
the moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-17 deployment.
{numref}`wh1_17_adcp_uv_cont.png`, through {numref}`wh1_17_adcp_w_cont.png`,
shows the ADCP current components` contours in context with data from the
previous deployments. Despite the gaps in the data, an apparent variability is
seen in the zonal and meridional currents, apparently caused by passing eddies.
There have been periods of intermittent positive or negative zonal currents on
top of this variability, for instance, during 2007-2008. The contours of the
vertical current component {numref}`wh1_17_adcp_w_cont.png` show a transition
in the magnitude of the contours near 47 m, indicating that the 300 kHz ADCP
located at 126 m moves more vertically than the 600 kHz ADCP located at 47.5 m.

A comparison between the moored ADCP data and the shipboard ADCP data obtained
during the WHOTS-17 cruise is shown in
{numref}`whots17deploy_adcp_contour1.png`, and
{numref}`whots17deploy_adcp_contour2.png`, and a similar comparison during the
WHOTS-18 cruise is shown in {numref}`whots17recover_adcp_contour1.png` and
{numref}`whots17recover_adcp_contour2.png`. Some differences were seen,
especially in the zonal component, maybe due to the mooring motion, which was
not removed from the data. Comparisons between the available shipboard ADCP
from HOT-333 to -336 cruises and the mooring data are shown in
{numref}`wh17_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png` through
{numref}`wh17_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_600_2.png`.

The Xeos-GPS receiver registered the WHOTS-17 buoy motion, and its positions
are plotted in {numref}`wh17xeos_pos.png`. The buoy was located west of the
anchor for most of the deployment. The power spectrum of these data
({numref}`wh17gps_spec_dpng.png`) shows extra energy at the inertial period (~31
hr). Combining the buoy motion with the tilt (a combination of pitch and roll)
from the ADCP data ({numref}`wh17_adcp_tilt.png`) showed that the tilt
increased as the buoy distance from the anchor WHOTS-17 increased. This was
expected since the inclination of the cable increases as the buoy moves away
from the anchor.

## Thermosalinograph Data

Underway measurements of near-surface temperature and salinity from the
thermosalinograph (TSG) system onboard the R/V Oscar Sette cruise are presented
in {numref}`ac40thsl_final.png` and navigational data is shown in
{numref}`ac40nav_final.png` for the WHOTS-17 cruise. The data between August 25
and 27, 2021 are particularly bad because it was during transit back to Oahu to
disembark a crew member with medical problems, and the flow through the system
was stopped during that time. TSG and navigational data during the WHOTS-18 cruise,
onboard the R/V Oscar Sette, are presented in {numref}`ac41thsl_final.png` and
{numref}`ac41nav_final.png`, respectively.

WHOTS-17 are presented in {numref}`wh17_Temp_1_4.png` through
{numref}`wh17_Temp_17_20.png` for each of the depths where the instruments
were located. The salinities are plotted in {numref}`wh17_Sali_1_4.png`
through {numref}`wh17_Sali_17_20.png`. The potential densities ({math}`\sigma\theta`) are
plotted in {numref}`wh17_Sigma_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh17_Sigma_17_20.png`.

Contoured plots of temperature and salinity as a function of depth for the
deployments WHOTS-1 through -16 are presented in {numref}`w1_17_contTS.png`,
and contoured plots of potential density ({math}`\sigma\theta`) as a function of depth are in
{numref}`w1_17_contSt.png`, and of salinity as a function of {math}`\sigma\theta`
are in {numref}`w1_17_cont_S.png`.

The potential temperature ({math}`\theta`) and salinity measured by the deep MicroCATs
during the mooring deployment are shown in {numref}`plt_w17_aco.png`. Also
shown in the plot are the {math}`\theta` and salinity data obtained with a MicroCAT (SBE-37)

## Moored ADCP Data

Contoured plots of smoothed horizontal (east and north component) and vertical
velocity as a function of depth during the mooring deployments 1 through 17 are
presented in {numref}`wh1_17_adcp_uv_cont.png` and
{numref}`wh1_17_adcp_w_cont.png`. A staggered time-series of smoothed
horizontal and vertical velocities are shown in
{numref}`WHOTS-17_u_subplot.png` through {numref}`WHOTS-17_w_subplot.png`.
Smoothing was performed by applying a daily running mean to the data and then
interpolating it on an hourly grid.

Contours of east and north velocity components from the Ship Oscar Sette Ocean
Surveyor broadband 75 kHz shipboard ADCP, and the moored 300 kHz ADCP from the

Contours of meridional currents ({math}`m s^{-1}`) from the Ship Oscar Sette Ocean
Surveyor narrowband 75 kHz shipboard ADCP (upper panel), and the moored 300 kHz
ADCP from the WHOTS-17 mooring (lower panel) as a function of time and depth,
during the WHOTS-18 cruise. Times when the CTD/rosette was in the water are
identified between the solid and dashed black lines.

Comparisons between quality-controlled moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-17
deployment and available shipboard ADCP obtained during regular HOT cruises 333
to 337, and during the mooring deployment (WHOTS-17) and recovery (WHOTS-18)
cruises are shown in {numref}`wh17_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png` for the 300
kHz ADCP. Median and mean velocity profiles were computed when HOT CTD casts
were being conducted near the WHOTS mooring specifically intended to calibrate
moored instrumentation (see {ref}`/5_section.md#conductivity-calibration`). The
HOT shipboard profiles were taken when the ship was stationary, within 1 km of
the mooring, and within 4 hours before the start and 4 hours after the end of
the CTD cast conducted near the WHOTS mooring.

The HOT cruises conducted on the R/V Kilo Moana from HOT-333 to -337 utilized
data from different types of acoustic instruments. The TRDI Ocean Surveyor 38
kHz operating in broadband mode (OS38BB) with a 12 m bin size and 5-minute
ensemble was employed for data collection. However, HOT-335 encountered a
failure in obtaining data, and HOT-337 experienced data interruption before completion.

Additionally, the cruises made use of the TRDI Ocean Surveyor 38 kHz operating
in narrowband mode (OS38NB) with a 24 m bin size and 5-minute ensemble.
Unfortunately, HOT-335 encountered a failure with the OS38NB after
approximately 18 hours into the cruise.

Furthermore, the Teledyne Workhorse 300 kHz with a 2 m bin size and 2-minute
ensemble was utilized for data acquisition during HOT-333 to HOT-337. HOT-337
experienced data interruption before its scheduled completion.

Comparisons between the 300 kHz and the shipboard ADCP were available for
HOT-333 to HOT-336 ({numref}`wh17_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png`); data from
HOT-337 was excluded due to a lack of comparable data. Comparisons between the moored 600 kHz and the shipboard ADCP were
available for HOT-333 to HOT-336 ({numref}`wh17_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_600_2.png`).

## Mooring Motion

The position of the mooring with respect to its anchor was determined from the
GPS positions. Additional information on the mooring motion was provided by the
ADCP data of pitch, roll, and heading, shown in this section.

{numref}`wh17_adcp_tilt.png` shows the ADCP data of the instrument’s tilt (a
combination of the pitch and roll), plotted against the buoy’s distance from
its anchor (derived from GPS positions), for both WHOTS-17 ADCP’s. The plot`s
red line is a quadratic fit to the median tilt calculated every 0.2 km distance
bins. The figure shows that during both deployments, the ADCP tilt increased as
the anchor`s distance increased. This tilting was caused by the mooring line`s
deviation from its vertical position as the anchor pulled it. The tilting of
the line also caused the rising of the instruments attached to the line.
